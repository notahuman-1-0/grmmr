Grammr aims to  be a software that can automatically correct grammar errors in written text. Grammr will utilize advanced natural language processing algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify and correct various types of grammatical errors. The software will be designed to work with a range of text formats, including emails, documents, and social media posts.

One of the key features of the software will be its ability to provide suggestions for improving writing style and clarity. This will include suggestions for alternative sentence structures, more concise wording, and more effective use of punctuation. 

Grammr will also be designed to provide feedback on common mistakes, such as the use of passive voice or the overuse of adverbs.
